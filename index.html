			<h1>Ricky Diaz Gomez</h1>
			<p>I was born and raised in southern California.</p>
			<p>I started playing soccer when I was about four.</p>
			<p>I am not that great at it anymore, but I am still absolutely in love with the sport.</p>
			<p>I am also in love with photography.</p>
			<p>I sometimes take pictures; here's <a href = "https://photos.app.goo.gl/T57dzmY4i4XSOfyO2" target="_blank">proof</a>.</p>
			<p>I now go to the University of Michigan, where I'm learning how to computer science.</p>
			<p>I write <a href = "https://www.github.com/rickydia" target="_blank">code</a> sometimes.</p>
			<p>I joined the world's first professional technology fraternity, <a href = "https://kappathetapi.com" target="_blank">Kappa Theta Pi</a>.</p>
			<p>I worked with a team of ten made that website.</p>
			<p>I have lately been working with <a href = "https://halthungerinitiative.weebly.com" target="_blank">Halt Hunger Initiative</a>, which is an amazing charity.
			<p>I strive to one day make food and clean water available to everyone.</p>
			<p>I have a more detailed <a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank">résumé</a> if you want to look.</p>
