			<h1>Ricky Diaz Gomez</h1>
			<p>I was born and raised in southern California.</p>
			<p>I moved to San Francisco.</p>
			<p>I now live in New York.</p>
			<p>I read comic books and maintain a pretty big collection.</p>
			<p>I watch a lot movies and I used to run a weekly <a href = "http://pfft.heroku.com" target="_blank">movie night</a>.</p>
			<p>I have a beautiful <a href = "http://www.anamonster.com" target="_blank">wife</a>, a hyperactive French Bulldog, and a neurotic cat.</p>
			<p>I write <a href = "http://www.github.com/ienders" target="_blank">code</a> and <a href = "http://www.twitter.com/ianenders" target="_blank">idiotic comments</a> about the things I see.</p>
			<p>I sometimes write <a href = "http://blog.ianenders.com">longer idiotic comments</a> too.</p>
			<p>I was the Creative Director and Head of Product at <a href = "http://www.pagerduty.com" target="_blank">PagerDuty</a>.</p>
			<p>I am not anymore, but they're still cool.</p>
			<p>I am working with some awesome people right now to disrupt an industry.</p>
			<p>I am the CTO of <a href = "http://www.newlywish.com">NewlyWish</a>, and we recently joined the <a href="http://www.weddingwire.com">WeddingWire</a> family.</p>
			<p>I am what hipsters aspire to be. Effortlessly hipster.</p>
			<p>I have a more detailed <a href="/resume.html">résumé</a> if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
