			<h1>Ricky Diaz Gomez</h1>
			<p>I was born and raised in Southern California.</p>
			<p>I started playing soccer when I was about four.</p>
			<p>I am not that great at it anymore, but I am still absolutely in love with the sport.</p>
			<p>I am also in love with both movies and photography.</p>
			<p>I sometimes take <a href = "https://photos.app.goo.gl/T57dzmY4i4XSOfyO2" target="_blank">pictures</a>.</p>
			<p>I now go to the University of Michigan, where I'm learning computer science.</p>
			<p>I write <a href = "https://www.github.com/rickydia" target="_blank">code</a> sometimes.</p>
			<p>I joined the world's first professional technology fraternity, <a href = "https://kappathetapi.com" target="_blank">Kappa Theta Pi</a>.</p>
			<p>I worked with a team of ten made that website.</p>
			<p>I have lately been working with <a href = "https://halthungerinitiative.weebly.com" target="_blank">Halt Hunger Initiative</a>, which is an amazing charity.
			<p>I am currently looking for an internship in software development for summer 2019.</p>
